# Santa-Monica-College-Waitlist-Trick
Over the course I attened in Santa Monica College, I always had the late enrollment date which caused me to have bad teachers. At my last year of SMC I made this program using Java and WebDriver (selenium) to increase my chance of getting into a class.

# So what's the idea? 
The idea is once the class is fulled you have the option to enter the open-seat-notification which later becomes the waitlist. SMC sends an email to your SMC's email address if the class gets open. All you need to do is run this program on a computer and leave it ON. This program will check your email to see if SMC has sent you an alert regarding class status. If it has then it will open chrome (make sure you have chrome) and automatically log you into SMC and adds the class for you. Make sure you change the values inside the code. 

# What else do I need?
As of now I will provide the libraries I used to do such task but you might need to get the newer versions. Here is a list of libraries I used:
- ChromeDriver
- Selenium Web Driver
- Java Mail API
